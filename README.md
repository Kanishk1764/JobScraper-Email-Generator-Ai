# AI-Powered Job Scraper & Cold Email Generator

## Overview
This project is an intelligent automation tool that scrapes job postings from websites, processes them using AI, and generates personalized cold emails for outreach. It leverages **LangChain, ChromaDB, and Groq's LLaMA-3.1-8B model** to extract job details, match them with relevant portfolio projects, and craft professional emails.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts job descriptions from career pages.
- **AI-Powered Processing**: Uses Groq's LLaMA-3.1-8B to analyze job descriptions.
- **Portfolio Matching**: Searches a stored portfolio using ChromaDB to find relevant projects.
- **Cold Email Generation**: Creates a professional, AI-generated email for business outreach.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **ChromaDB**
- **Groq LLaMA-3.1-8B**
- **Pandas** (for handling CSV data)
